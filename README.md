# Heart_Disease_classifier

This dataset is taken from UCI Heart disease dataset for cleveland.

Dataset has 303 samples and 14 attributes.

There are 13 feature columns and a target variable 'AHD'

    Sex, ChestPain, Fbs, RestECG, ExAng, Slope, Ca Thal are Categorical Features 
    Age, RestBP, Chol, MaxHR and Oldpeak are continuous variables.
    
Description of attributes:

sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)

Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) 

Restbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

Chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

Fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

Restecg: resting electrocardiographic results

    Value 0: normal 
    Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)     
    Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
   
Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

      The heart status as retrieved from Thallium test, (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect) (discrete)

Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

    Value 1: upsloping 
    Value 2: flat 
    Value 3: downsloping
    
MaxHR = maxium heart rate

AHD: Atherosclerotic Heart Disease
